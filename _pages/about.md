I am interested in how the interplay between learning, memory, and cognitive control guides goal-directed behavior (e.g., decision strategies, planning).
For instance how the brain assigns value to options in order to inform decisions, or how the brain implements internal simulations to direct planning.

In my research I use behavioral experiments in combination with neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG, iEEG) and computational modelling (e.g., reinforcement learning).

<Before joining Ghent University, I completed my masters in Biomedical Engineering at University of Lübeck, in Germany,
where I worked at the [Life Span group](https://www.ipsy1.uni-luebeck.de/forschung/ag-bunzeck/) led by Nico Bunzeck.
And before that I got an Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering degree at [UTPL](https://www.utpl.edu.ec/), in Loja, Ecuador,
where I worked with [Manuel Quiñones](https://investigacion.utpl.edu.ec/mfquinonez) on designing and implementing wireless sensor networks.>
