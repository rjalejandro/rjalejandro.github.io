I am interested in how the interplay between learning, memory, and cognitive control guides goal-directed behavior (e.g., decision strategies, planning).
For instance how the brain assigns value to options in order to inform decisions, or how the brain implements internal simulations to direct mental planning.

In my research I use behavioral experiments in combination with neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG, iEEG) and computational modelling (e.g., reinforcement learning).

I completed my BSc in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at [UTPL](https://www.utpl.edu.ec/), where I worked with
[Manuel Quiñones](https://investigacion.utpl.edu.ec/mfquinonez) on designing and implementing wireless sensor networks.
I completed my MSc in Biomedical Engineering at University of Lübeck, where I worked with [Nico Bunzeck](https://www.ipsy1.uni-luebeck.de/forschung/ag-bunzeck/) on semantic
memory across the life-span.

Currently, I am a PhD researcher at Ghent University working with [Clay Holroyd](https://lccl.ugent.be/) on diverse aspects of human cognition.
